### **Overview**
The architecture diagram below shows the stages of an Intelligent Document Processing workflow. It starts with a data capture stage to securely store, aggregate different types (pdf, jpeg, png, tiff), formats, and layouts of documents. The next stage is classification, this is where you categorize your documents (for example categories such as contracts, claim forms, invoices, receipts and so on) followed by document extraction. In the extraction stage, you can extract meaningful business information from your documents. This extracted data is often used to gather insights via data analysis, or sent to downstream systems such as databases or transactional systems. The following stage is enrichment, at this stage documents can be enriched by redacting PII data, custom business term extraction, and so on. Finally, in the review/verification stage you can include a human workforce for document reviews to ensure the outcome is accurate.

### Before we begin
Let's look at a brief overview of Amazon Textract, Amazon Comprehend, and Amazon Augmented AI (A2). These are the AWS AI services that will be used in this workshop.

### Amazon Textract
**Amazon Textract** is a machine learning service that automatically extracts text, handwriting, and data from scanned documents. It goes beyond simple optical character recognition (OCR) to identify, understand, and extract data from forms and tables. Today, many companies manually extract data from scanned documents such as PDFs, images, tables, and forms, or through simple OCR software that requires manual configuration (which often must be updated when the form changes). To overcome these manual and expensive processes, Textract uses ML to read and process any type of document, accurately extracting text, handwriting, tables, and other data with no manual effort. You can quickly automate document processing and act on the information extracted, whether youâ€™re automating loans processing or extracting information from invoices and receipts. Textract can extract the data in minutes instead of hours or days. Additionally, you can add human reviews with Amazon Augmented AI to provide oversight of your models and check sensitive data.

### Amazon Comprehend
**Amazon Comprehend** is a natural-language processing (NLP) service that uses machine learning to uncover information in unstructured data. The service can identify critical elements in data, including references to language, people, places, and the text files can be categorized by relevant topics. You can automatically and accurately detect human sentiment from content generated by your users (such as product reviews, social media posts etc.), in real-time. This accelerates more informed decision making to improve customer experiences. Amazon Comprehend not only locates any content that contains personally identifiable information, it can also redact and masks that content. Comprehend is fully managed, so you can get up and running quickly to start processing millions of documents in minutes by leveraging the power of machine learning.

### Amazon Augmented AI (A2I)
**Amazon Augmented AI** is a machine learning service which makes it easy to build the workflows required for human review. Amazon A2I brings human review to all developers, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with building human review systems or managing large numbers of human reviewers whether it runs on AWS or not. Amazon A2I integrates both with Amazon Textract  and Amazon Comprehend  to provide you the ability to introduce human review steps within your intelligent document processing workflow.
